Backup for files on the PrograMath website

PrograMath (at one point in history at http://www.programath.co.nf) was my first coding project for school. This was created as my final project for my PLTW class in eighth grade, annd was the first time I shared a piece of code that I had written. I explored how HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP tied together to make a simple website. (The PHP is not currently working.)
